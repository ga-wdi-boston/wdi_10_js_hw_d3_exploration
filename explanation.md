Olympic Medals for London 2012 - The D3 edition

My data was taken from http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/2012/

In this chart I wanted to show the medal counts for the London 2012 for the top 10 medal earning countries. My data was taken from http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/2012/. I limited the scope of this chart to the top 10 as there were 85 medal earning countries and I felt that with too much data the chart would not be as visually interesting. I thought the multi-bar chart was the best way to represent this data as it would be easy to compare countries for each medal color as well as overall total. I think it would be nice to add animation to this so when the user mouses over a particular color bar, the other bars fade or disappear to really emphasize that particular data.

The issue I didn't take into account when I picked this chart format is that there are two x-axes. x0 is the axis the graph bars sit on, while x1 is the axis is actually labelled. It was a little hard to grasp the concept of needing two x-axes especially when there's only one y. Once the actual axes were defined, the next step was to define the format of the bars. Finally I appended all the pieces of the graph together. The last step was to add a legend. Adding the rectangle to the graph wasn't hard, but formatting it correctly so it displayed correctly took some work.
