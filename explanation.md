Ideally, I would want to display the growth of population over time by increasing the radii via d3 - however, due to the limited time, I had to disgard my original data set and used the current one instead to map out the loneliest countries in the world. However, this data set is perhaps still too large for the purpose of this exercise. Hence, I spent too long trying to filter out the relevant data and did not get the chance to explore the more exciting parts of d3!
To render my mini countries, I first loaded the data set and then set my d3 elements as variables so that I can append multiple svg elements to them later. From then on, it's pretty basic: creating circles and positioning them using the attributes I wanted to visualize from the data set (population size and region).
In addition to adding animations, there are still a lot of refactoring and improving I would like to do to this chart, including research alternatives to .filter() and set.values() as those methods did not render the results I was looking for (countries with population under 1000 and unique values for the legend).
