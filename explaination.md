I research Donut Chart in the class lab and now I research Animated Donut Chart with Labels for homework. I put comments before each function or even each line of this chart. I have combine the Donut Chart with the Animated Donut Chart with Labels, I create a data.csv for Animated Donut Chart with Labels. In this case, you can click random and it will change the location of each age-population group in the chart. Also, you can check my comments for more detail information.
