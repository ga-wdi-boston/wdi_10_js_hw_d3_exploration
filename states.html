    <p>States are alphabetical with AL at the inside, but it's too small to
        append the state names and I couldn't figure out individual click or
        mouseover handlers to display the statename . The outer one would capture the initial mouseover and subsequently moving into inner rings didn't fire additional events (because we're still over the outer one).
